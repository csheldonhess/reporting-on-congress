# Reporting on Congress

What has Congress passed and not passed, lately? (This is still a work in progress. Have a look at the output text files for now. [reverse_chronological_output.txt](https://github.com/csheldonhess/reporting-on-congress/blob/master/reverse_chronological_output.txt) is a list of everything, from most recent to oldest. [pass_fail_order.txt](https://github.com/csheldonhess/reporting-on-congress/blob/master/pass_fail_order.txt) is a list of everything that passed, then a list of everything that failed. Really, I'd like to make this into a website, not just some text files.)

To download and run this yourself, you're going to want to register for an API key from [ProPublica](https://projects.propublica.org/api-docs/congress-api/) and put it in a file called api-key.txt, in the same directory as the code.
