# Reporting on Congress

What has Congress passed and not passed, lately? (This is still a work in progress. Have a look at the output text files for now. [reverse_chronological.md](https://github.com/csheldonhess/reporting-on-congress/blob/master/docs/reverse_chronological.md) is a list of everything, from most recent to oldest. [passed.md](https://github.com/csheldonhess/reporting-on-congress/blob/master/docs/passed.md) is a list of everything that passed, and [failed.md](https://github.com/csheldonhess/reporting-on-congress/blob/master/docs/failed.md) is a list of everything that failed then a list of everything that failed. Really, I'd like to make this into a website, not just Markdown on GitHub.)

To download and run this yourself, you're going to want to register for an API key from [ProPublica](https://projects.propublica.org/api-docs/congress-api/) and put it in a file called api-key.txt, in the same directory as the code.
